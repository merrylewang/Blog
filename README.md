This is a blog interface written in Python 3 and Flask. It uses Neo4J as the backend database and py2neo to connect it with python. The blog can register users and see recent posts by yourself and other user; you can also see users' profiles and similar users. 

The user class is written in models.py and views.py contains the urls to different html files.

This was based on the Microblog and Neo4j tutorial by Nicole White.
